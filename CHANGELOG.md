## ✨ Highlights

> This week was huge! We completely revamped how skills are organized — making them easier to find and use. Plus, we added powerful new tools: local code review, auto-commit capabilities, a changelog generator, and a meta-skill that helps you create new skills. Your workflow just got a serious upgrade!

## 🚀 New Features

- **Local Code Review** — New `review:local` skill performs thorough code review before you commit! Get feedback on bugs, security issues, and code quality with structured severity levels.

- **Changelog Generator** — You can now automatically create beautiful, human-readable changelogs from your git history. Perfect for sharing progress with non-technical teams!

- **Auto-Commit on Task Completion** — Tasks now automatically commit your work when completed, following Conventional Commits format. One less thing to remember!

- **Task Execution Skills** — New `spec:do-all`, `spec:do-next`, and `spec:do-task` commands let you execute implementation tasks directly from your specifications. Work through your task list without leaving the flow.

- **Git Workflow Skills** — New `git:commit` and `git:amend` skills for smart conventional commits with auto-detected commit types.

- **Skill Creation Helper** — The new `dev:skill` meta-skill helps you create properly structured skill definitions. Building skills is now easier than ever!

- **Specification Skills** — Full suite of spec-driven development tools: requirements gathering, technical design, and task breakdown — all working together seamlessly.

## 💪 Improvements

- **Better Organization** — Skills are now organized into intuitive category folders (`spec/`, `git/`, `utils/`, `dev/`) instead of flat naming. Finding the right skill is much easier!

- **Expanded Tool Support** — Now works with Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode in addition to existing integrations.

- **Consistent Naming** — All skills now follow the `category:name` format for a cleaner, more predictable experience.

- **Vibrant Documentation** — README and docs got a fresh makeover with better examples and clearer explanations.
